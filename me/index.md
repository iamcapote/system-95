# 🌀 System95 | Research Collective  
🚀 *Building Adaptive Systems at the Intersection of Biology & Technology*  

---  

## **📂 About Us**  
We explore decentralized systems through three key lenses:  
1. **Cognitive Architectures** → Decision-making models in neural, social, and blockchain networks  
2. **Biological Computation** → Biomimicry, bio-inspired algorithms, synthetic biology  
3. **Protocol Evolution** → DAO governance mechanisms, crypto-economic incentive designs  

Our work focuses on **bridging biologically inspired designs with decentralized computation**, researching how **systems adapt, self-regulate, and evolve over-time**.
